I love Satisfactory, you probably do too. Between us we've probably sunk hundreds if not thousands of hours into it. No regrets. With that amount of time doing anything, it's natural to want to push the boundries of the sandbox. FicsIt-Networks is a wonderful mod that lets you do just that. A few new components and some simple code you can really show MASSAGE-2(A-B)b what a Pioneer is capable of. 

When gazing down on your latest sprawling industrial complex -- FicsIt cup in hand -- have you ever thought: "I wish I could automate this *even more*"? Perhaps you long for that central control room, bristling with working displays and retro-future control panels. There are mods that can do all these things out of the box. While they may get the job done, where is the satisfaction? This is a game for people that like to build things.

If you've wanted to build that control room and *really* make it your own, or if you want to learn to how to code but are tired of Todo lists and Address Book tutorials these guides, snippets and examples might be useful. Learning is best when it's fun, and Satisfactory is some of the best fun you can have a computer. Who says playing computer games can't be productive? 

Look on my works, ye mighty, and take notes. Don't forget to say hello on the Discord too!
