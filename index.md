When gazing down on your latest sprawling industrial complex -- FicsIt cup in hand -- have you ever thought: "How could automate this *even more*?" Perhaps you long for that central control room, bristling with working displays and retro-future control panels.

Maybe you want to learn to how to code but are tired of Todo lists and Address Book tutorials. In the spirit of classic [Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/) projects I'm hoping these guides, snippets and examples might be useful. 

I'm by no means an expert so let's figure it out together. Learning is best when it's fun and Satisfactory is some of the best fun you can have a computer. Who says playing computer games can't be productive? 

Don't forget to say hello on Discord too!
